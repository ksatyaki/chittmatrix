ChittMatrix is yet another Matrix Library. This library has been created
with the hope that it is a lot simpler than most available libraries.

The best thing about this library is that it is created by a rookie.
So it helps all rookies best. The syntax is so simple to use.

Bugs are few. This is all you need to begin basic linear algebra. 
No advanced functions have been implemented yet.
